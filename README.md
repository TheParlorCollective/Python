The provided code defines a function 

create_html_templates

 that generates HTML templates for a Tattoo Management System. The function creates three HTML templates: `index.html`, `add_artist.html`, and `add_parlor.html`. Each template is defined as a multi-line string within the function.

The `index.html` template is a basic webpage that displays lists of artists, parlors, and clients. It uses Jinja2 templating syntax to iterate over lists of artists, parlors, and clients, displaying their names and other relevant information.

The `add_artist.html` template provides a form for adding a new artist. The form includes fields for the artist's name, bio, portfolio links, preferred styles, and ratings. When the form is submitted, it sends a POST request to the server.

The `add_parlor.html` template provides a form for adding a new parlor. The form includes fields for the parlor's name and address. Similar to the artist form, it sends a POST request upon submission.

After defining the templates, the function writes each template to a corresponding file in the `templates` directory. It uses Python's built-in 

open

 function to create and write to the files `index.html`, `add_artist.html`, and `add_parlor.html`. Finally, the function prints a message indicating that the HTML templates have been created successfully.

This function is useful for setting up the initial HTML structure for a web application, ensuring that the necessary templates are in place for displaying and adding artists and parlors.
